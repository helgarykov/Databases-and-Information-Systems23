# Databases and Information Systems (DIS 23)

For the group project submission, please see the `Project/EasyTranslate` folder! This whole repository is multipurpose: a mono-repo for the whole of Databases and Information Systems.

**Content**

This course introduces students to basic database concepts such as relational databases, normal forms, and transactions. In addition, the course covers system development (basic software development) and version control and includes the practical development of a smaller system (web system, mobile system, or the like, which must be decided before the course starts) as project work. Formal languages and reading of structured text are also covered.

**Learning Outcome**

**Knowledge of**

- Key database technical concepts such as the relational model, data independence and transactions.
- Entity-relationship modeling (ER modeling) and relational data modeling, including transformations from ER modeling to relational data modeling.
- Queries in database query languages, including relational calculus, relational algebra, and SQL.
- The theory of database normalization, including functional dependencies, keys, and relational decompositions.
- ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) properties and use of transactions.
- Indexing techniques and their role in database query optimization.
- Use of constraints and triggers.
- Facilities for connecting databases, programming environments, and program libraries.
- Methods for reading structured texts (i.e. regular expressions, finite automata, context-free grammars).
- Data protection regulation (GDPR)
 
**Skills in**

- Developing a data model and realizing database applications starting from the ER modeling, over relational modeling and normalization, to concrete relational, SQL-based database application.
- Planning and managing an agile, iterative, and learning-oriented system development process, which under given resource and time constraints leads to the realization of a new database application.
 
**Competence in**

- Developing a database design and implement database applications.
- Effectively participating in an agile software development process as part of a group of developers.
