DIS  Assignment 1
Exercise 1.
-----------
a) E/R model
  Wrong - You MUST use the format (arrows, etc.) depicted in the text book.
  A relationship between two boxes (entities), MUST have a diamond element between them.
  How do I identify if an element (box) is a relationship or an entity ?
  How do I identify if a entity is weak ?
  -> if using a format different from the text book GUW, you MUST write have to read the elements !!!

b) Modeling choices
-------------------
b1) Entities OR Relationships
  OK

b2) Using n-ary relationships ?
  YES - How do I see this in the E/R diagram ?
  
b3) Uniqueness / Constraints / Weak entities / ISA
  OK, but also see a) above.
  Use of ON DELETE... is very good.
  Good use of weak entities. 


c) Relational model (SQL)
  Naming convention:
  -> Make sure we can identify tables in the E/R-diagram.
  13  OKs
  Very good.

d) Signature and database schema
  13 OKs
  
e) Formulas (RC)
----------------
(i)
  OK

(ii)
  OK

(iii)
  OK

(iv)
  OK


Message to alle submissions (maybe not relevant for your submission)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If using a format different from the text book GUW, you MUST write how to read the elements !!!

Arrows is a count (not a direction). It goes from entity to entity (not entity to relationship).
Use the arrows depicted in the text book GUW.

A relationship between two boxes (entities), MUST have a diamond element between them.

A running primary key "is the poor man's key" and should be avoided if possible.

Candidates for Weak entities are entities that cannot stand alone, 
ie. it often have a running number as primary key or no primary key.
If the entity only makes sence using a primary key (tuple) in another entity, 
then is should be weak, and the entity with the primary key is a 'Supporting Entity'.

Separate entities and relationships in SQL makes it easier to understand + change.

Can a dish exist if it isn’t offered by a restaurant ?

Different kind of orders (Take away, Take out, United) is an ISA-relationship.

A food order must have at least one dish, correct ?
-> does that mean we must have a referential constraint ?

end.
